/**
 * `@iveri/contracts` is compiled into browser and React Native bundles. A single runtime
 * dependency — `class-validator`, `@nestjs/common`, anything reaching for `node:` builtins — would
 * either break those bundles or quietly bloat them.
 *
 * The rule is stated in the workspace CLAUDE.md; this is the enforcement. It runs in `build`, so
 * CI fails on the PR that adds the dependency rather than on a frontend build weeks later.
