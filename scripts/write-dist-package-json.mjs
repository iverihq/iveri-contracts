/**
 * The package root declares `"type": "commonjs"`, which Node applies to every `.js` file
 * beneath it — including the ESM build. These two marker files scope the module system per
 * directory so `dist/esm` is treated as ESM and `dist/cjs` as CommonJS.
 *
 * Without them the `import` condition in `exports` resolves to a file Node then parses as
 * CommonJS, and the package fails at runtime with "Cannot use import statement outside a
 * module".
